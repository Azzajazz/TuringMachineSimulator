# Turing Machine Simulator and Editor

This is intended to be a tool to build and run Turing Machines. It is not functional currently, but here's some intended features:
- Visual editing and creation of Turing Machines
- Debugging of Turing Machines (step, run, reset, etc.)
- Support for Turing Machine extensions (non-determinism, alternating, multi-tape, etc.)
- Designing and saving of Turing Machine "modules". Modules can be pieces together in various ways to make more complicated Turing Machines
